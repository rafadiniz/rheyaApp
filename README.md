### RHEYA

### Implemetation
RHEYA is an application that works as a permanent audiovisual installation. The application is implemented from computational tools (OpenFrameWorks) that explore sound and image synthesis. In this version, the installation should be presented only with monitor or projection and stereo speakers or headphones. RHEYA is a work in progress and should still evolve a lot in other versions, possibly being implemented in VR.

### Concept
RHEYA refers to the main element (character) of the application, in which it is represented by a structure of mesh repeating loops that attempt to form a female face, referencing frames from a Youtuber video of Vanessa van Edwars teaching about expressions and how to release people's insides.The character was inspired by the science fiction character Solaris (1961), the original novel by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem. In short, Solaris is a planet where your ocean has consciousness and the ability to control and materialize dreams and memories of humans (astronauts). Thus Rheya would be the materialized memory of the late wife of astronaut and psychologist Kris Kevin. As Kevin seeks to understand how Solaris' ocean consciousness works, Rheya appears and disappears several times, with each reappearance the character becomes increasingly complex. From this, establishing Solaris as a kind of myth, in our interpretation, we highlight the figure of Rheya and thus propose a reflection / instance, in the form of sound and image, about science, belief, subjectivity and humanity. Thus, in RHEYA, technical / synthetic forms, through algorithms, seek to create relationship with natural and human forms, acting between something that is projected temporally as sensory drama at the same time as a static ready-made.
